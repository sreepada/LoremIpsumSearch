1) 
    a) Indeed there exists trend in the collection and discussion of oil and other resources. We found pages every year right from 1966 till 2014. This shows that people were interested in oil and resources as old as 1962 and as recently as 2014

    b)Yes these are limited to certain geographic regions mainly Canada, Northern Europe, Arctic Ocean, Scandanavia,  Alaska, Chucki Sea, Russia, Eurasia, Hudson Bay

2) There are about 88 regions of interest. Some of them are

Canada, Alaska, Atlantic Ocean, Alaska Arctic Ocean, Beaufort Sea Vertical Location, Northwest Territories Canada, Geographic Region, Western Hemisphere Canada, Northern Europe, Arctic Arctic Ocean, Bering Sea Arctic Ocean, Arctic United States Of America, Chukchi Sea Arctic Ocean Vertical Location, Atlantic Ocean, Northern Hemisphere Canada Canada, Arctic Ocean Canada North America, Alaska, Barents Sea, Nunavut Geographic Region, Polar Geographic Region, Northern Hemisphere, North America Geographic Region, Russia Arctic Ocean, Greenland, North Atlantic Ocean, Global, Troposphere North America, Nunavut, Greenland Arctic Ocean, Beaufort Sea Arctic Ocean, Northwest Territories Arctic Ocean Canada, United States Of America, Alaska Canada, North America United States Of America, Norway, Hudson Bay Geographic Region, Russia Geographic Region, Northern Hemisphere Canada, Northwest Territories Continent, Russia Continent, Nunavut Canada Vertical Location, Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean North America, Chukchi Sea Pacific Ocean, North America, Alaska Pacific Ocean, Eurasia, Beaufort Sea, Bering Sea, Alaska Vertical Location, Land Surface, Continent, Svalbard And Jan Mayen, Hudson Bay Arctic Ocean, Polar United States Of America, Europe, Land Surface Arctic Ocean, Chukchi Sea, Arctic North America, Vertical Location, Arctic, Chukchi Sea Arctic Ocean, Sea Surface, Alaska North America, Northern Hemisphere Vertical Location, Troposphere, Northern Hemisphere Atlantic Ocean United States Of America Vertical Location, Northern Hemisphere North America, Arctic Vertical Location, Eurasia Geographic Region, Chukchi Sea Arctic Ocean, Arctic Canada, Arctic Geographic Region, British Columbia, North Pacific Ocean, Hudson Bay, Iceland, Polar North America, Beaufort Sea North America, Sea Surface North America, Arctic Ocean, Eastern Europe, Nunavut North America, Scandanavia

3) Following are the regions of national security - 
Canada, Vertical Location, Eurasia Geographic Region, Chukchi Sea Arctic Ocean Arctic Ocean, Beaufort Sea Arctic Ocean, Northwest Territories Arctic Ocean Canada, Alaska Atlantic Ocean, United States Of America, Svalbard And Jan Mayen, Alaska Arctic Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, Norway, Polar United States Of America, Hudson Bay, Chukchi Sea, Arctic North America, Hudson Bay Geographic Region, Northern Europe, Arctic, Arctic Arctic Ocean, Bering Sea Arctic Ocean, Arctic United States Of America, Chukchi Sea Arctic Ocean, Pacific Ocean, Sea Surface North America, Alaska, Chukchi Sea Pacific Ocean, Arctic Ocean North America, North America, Arctic Ocean, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Polar Geographic Region, Geographic Region, Atlantic Ocean, Eurasia, Greenland, Bering Sea, North Atlantic Ocean, Global, Alaska Vertical Location, Land Surface, Nunavut, Scandanavia

   All these areas have either oil, natural gas, iron, diamonds, rare isotope elements. However, national security interests are not only because of these resources, but also to study vegetation change, temperature change, study of sea ice cover and weather conditions. 

4) We found lot of scientific measurements are related to climate change are both time based and geographic region based. Recent past has shown lot of study in Tundra region - where subsoil is permanently frozen. Lot of study is undergoing, measuring weekly surface temperature, sea ice concenteration and ocean heat content.
    Note that query-4e is mainly concenterating on measuring how global temprature change is affecting sea ice extent(like ITP- Ice tethered Profiling). Note that focus on the ice extent measurement are those areas with greatest ice retreat i.e., the northern Beaufort, Chukchi, East Siberian, and Laptev Seas. 


5) Sea ice content and Polar bears
   We found that there is research going on to understand reduced sea ice in artic impact polar bears. Note that these studies were restricted to Alaska.
